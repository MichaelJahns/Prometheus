Personal Discord Bot
Visit us here: NOT PUBLISHED

## Project Info & Problem Domain
Prometheus began as a stab into using the discord js library to add simple utility functions to me and my friends discord server;
to remove the clutter of other Bots messages, to randomly assign a team captain, and to remember who has been team captain, when.
At the head of Covid-19 I added additionally the Lady of the Lake app to Prometheus, to host an Avalon; the Resistance game over a
discord voice channel

## Version 1.0.0

## Technology Used:
- JavaScript
- Express.js
- Discord.js

## Lady Of The Lake:
Lady of the Lake is a port of Avalon; the Resistance by Don Eskridge that setups up a game appropriate to the number of voice members 
Lady of the Lake assigns game roles at the start of the game, keeps track of game state, prints rules and gameboard in an embed
